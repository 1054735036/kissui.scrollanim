# kissui.scrollanim
CSS3 scroll animation library

This library is a part of Kissui project.

# Getting Started

Scrollanim has only one dependecy to [`kissui.position`](https://github.com/usablica/kissui.position) (to detect the position of elements on the page). Install this dependecy using bower, npm or whatever you prefer. It exports AMD and Browser Global object. 

> Please note that you don't need jQuery, Angular.js, React, Whatever. 

Then, simply include `kissui.scrollanim` in your page and write your first awesome scroll animation:

```
<p data-kui-anim="fadeIn">Show this with fade-in</p>
```

Simple, isn't it?
